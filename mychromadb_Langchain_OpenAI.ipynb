We’ve found that using multiple languages can help us create more robust and reliable applications.\\n\\nOne of the main benefits of polyglot programming is that it allows us to use the best language for the job. Different languages have different strengths and weaknesses, so by using multiple languages, we can ensure that our code is optimized for the task at hand.\\n\\nFor example, we might use TypeScript for a web application, Java for a back-end service, and Python for data analysis.
